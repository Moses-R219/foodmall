BUNDLER ---------PARCEL,WEBPACK,VITE,ESBLIND
PARCEL IS BEST TOOL FOR BUNDLER WHICH HAVE ALL MODULES ARE WRITTEN AND GIVE OUTPUT AS JS FILE
HMR-(HOT MODULE REPLACEMENT) automatically reloads the live localhost when any file changes it uses FILE WATCHER Algorithm which is written in C++
Parcel is used to remove console log but it not 


npm init will  generate package.json
npm i -D parcel to install it as devDependencies only for developer machine not in production
script types ---- homework

we need to add package-lock.json in git dont add in gitignore




npx==npm run
babel plugin transform remove console
react conciliation key react documentation 	
no same key for two tags/elements or siblings 
React.createElement gives us an Object
what is difference between HTML and JSX

JSX uses React.createElement in backend most of us don't know   babel converts JSX into React.createElement


const head=<h1>Namaste React</h1>------->JSX
	|
	|
	|
const head=React.createElement("h1",{},"Namaste react"); converted by Babel



Functional Component---it is normal function in javascript

Component name starts with Capital Letter it is not must but it is recommended for good practice.

Component Composition----using component inside component it is kown as component composition


React.Fragment is used to avoid the use of extra div when there is already div with id="root"
React.Fragment is a component which is exported from React ----it is like an empty tag <></>
jsx must have one and only parent element


can we use React.Fragment inside React.Fragment?
Optional chaining (?.)
React Key ---uses reconciliation diff Algorithm
React Fiber archtitecture
Never ever use index as key in react


We can export component by two types
	1.export  by default 
		syntax:export default Title 
	2.export  by name(const) 
		syntax:export const Title 
export default is used for exporting only one component

While importing these they will differ
	import Title from "./component/Title";-------Default import
	import {Title} from "./component/Title";-------Named import



Hooks==
		It is normal function with some extra function
useState return a new array which is used to store an local state variable
const [variable_name,function to change variable_name]=useState();

useEffect===>
		useEffect((callback),dependency)
		empty array dependency=== will be called once after rendering
		dependency array[variable_name]===will be called once + again for everytime changes in value
